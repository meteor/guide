This guide is quite short and we think you'll find the upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5 quite painless.  We encourage reading [full history](http://docs.meteor.com/changelog.html) and comparing the \full differences between the versions you are upgrading from and to.

<h2 id="older-versions">Migrating from a version older than 1.4?</h2>

If you're migrating from a version of Meteor older than Meteor 1.4, there may be important considerations not listed in this guide (which specifically covers 1.4 to 1.5).  Please review the older migration guides for details:

* [Migrating to Meteor 1.4](1.4-migration.html) (from 1.3)
* [Migrating to Meteor 1.3](1.3-migration.html) (from 1.2)

<h3 id="mail-url">`MAIL_URL` should be reviewed</h3>

Due to an upgrade in the underlying dependency for the [`email` package](http://docs.meteor.com/api/email.html), it is necessary to check that your `MAIL_URL` is using the correct scheme (e.g. `smtps://` or `smtp://`).

Previously, Meteor would automatically assume that any `MAIL_URL` which used port 465 was meant to be a secure scheme and automatically change `smtp://` to `smtps://` as necessary.  However, this is not always desired, and
not a safe assumption for Meteor to make since port numbers are simply recommendations.

If your `MAIL_URL` is using a secure TLS or SSL transport, **be sure that the `MAIL_URL` starts with `smtps://` and not just `smtp://`.**

Again, generally speaking, this applies to applications whose `MAIL_URL` already includes `:465`.
Note that applications listening on port `:587` are typically secured using a connection-upgrade mechanism, thus they start unencrypted and should therefore use `smtp://`
More information can be found in the [Nodemailer docs](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/)
