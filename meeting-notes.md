## Standup 16th Oct

With Zol, Tom, and Sashko

### Decisions

* Will be tracked via waffle on Github: [done](https://waffle.io/meteor/guide?label=article)
* Tool to build the website will be: MD, static website, continuous deployment, github backed, public, accept pull requests supports multiple versions. Sidebar, versions selector.
* Design/Branding will be done as a pass over the content, rather than a top-down design process.

### Approach

1. Deciding what the articles are and first pass of outline. [Done]
2. Second pass on outlines/polish - publishing decisions so far, soliciting community response with decisions and feedback. Action items/etc in GH issues. Setup waffle/etc [In progress].
3. Apply decisions to example app.
4. Content - Per article states (empty, outline, RFC, rough content, first draft). All articles in 'first draft' state == First draft milestone.

### Milestones

* All ideations initiated
* All outlines written
* First draft -> concerted effort to get feedback from everyone (Mid Dec)
* Website, CI, and tooling set up (Mid Dec)
* Visual design finalized (Mid Dec)
* Soft launch of entire site (Christmas)
